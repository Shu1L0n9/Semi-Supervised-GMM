## Algorithm Overview

The Semi-Supervised Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM) is a mixture of experts classifier that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. The core idea of this method is:

- **Labeled Data**: Used for supervised learning to directly optimize classification performance
- **Unlabeled Data**: Used for unsupervised learning through EM algorithm to improve model density estimation
- **Hybrid Learning**: Combines information from both data types to improve classification accuracy and generalization ability

Supports three types of covariance matrices:
- `spherical`: Spherical covariance (independent components with equal variance)
- `diag`: Diagonal covariance (independent components with unequal variance)
- `full`: Full covariance (allows correlation between components)

## Experiment Scripts

#### 2. synthetic_data_classification.m
Synthetic data classification experiment. Performs classification on dollar sign-shaped synthetic data, primarily evaluating SGMM classification performance using full covariance matrices.

### Python Experiments

#### 1. train_sgmm.py
SGMM training script providing complete training process and parameter settings.

#### 2. sgmm_core.py
Contains core SGMM algorithm implementation, including initialization, EM algorithm updates, and prediction functions.
